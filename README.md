## R sample (Fitting Power Law Distribution)

This is part of a project Tolerance Principle. Is to test word frequency distribution in children's early utterances. The data used in the code sample is the ranked word frequency in the early utterances of one child (Adam). In the code sample, I fitted the word frequency to four distributions: power law, lognormal, exponential and poisson.

## Python sample (Copy_of_Pronoun_Model)

This is part o I predicted the case of pronoun X in a flexible trigram frame. For example, in the phrase "Can X go", X is a nominative case and in the phrase "Let X go", X is an accusative case. The data used in the this sample is preprocessed text data generated from six parents' utterances. The model is a simple feed forward model with "aX" and "Xb" as input. The output is the case of the pronoun.
