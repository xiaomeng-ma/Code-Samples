## R sample (Fitting Distribution)

This is part of a project of testing Tolerance Principle. The purpose of this sample code is to fit the word frequency in children's early utterances to a power law distribution. The data used in the code sample is the ranked word frequency in the early utterances of one child (Adam). In the code sample, I fitted the word frequency to four distributions: power law, lognormal, exponential and poisson.

## Python sample (Copy_of_Pronoun_Model)

This is part o I predicted the case of pronoun X in a flexible trigram frame. For example, in the phrase "Can X go", X is a nominative case and in the phrase "Let X go", X is an accusative case. The data used in the this sample is preprocessed text data generated from six parents' utterances. The model is a simple feed forward model with "aX" and "Xb" as input. The output is the case of the pronoun.
